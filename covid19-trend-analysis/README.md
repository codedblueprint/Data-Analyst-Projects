# COVID-19 Global Trends Analysis


### 📁 Project Summary

This project analyzes COVID-19 global trends using data from **Our World in Data**. It includes **time-series visualizations**, **vaccination progress**, **continent-level comparisons**, and **correlation analysis** (e.g., GDP vs vaccination rate). The analysis is performed using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** and **SQLite for SQL-based exploration**.

---

### 📌 Objectives

* Analyze confirmed cases, death rates, and vaccinations globally and by country.
* Visualize monthly and daily trends.
* Compare regions and continents.
* Correlate GDP per capita with vaccination coverage.
